# Jamaica Youth Vision Project

## üíª Introduction
Our project, Children's Home Matchmaking, seeks to address one of the main problems in Jamaican society: Social Inequity. Many Children's homes in Jamaica are heavily dependent on donations, yet getting in contact with a home is rather difficult. Our project seeks to create a pathway between donors and homes, specifically tailored to the homes' needs. Homes may have a variety of needs, which is the reason for our matchmaking system. This project will allow us to play our part in tackling social inequity. By giving the homes greater exposure, we hope to reach a target audience of those who are well off and willing to distribute and share resources and funds, to create a more equal, caring society.

## ü§îHow it Works
With Children's Home Matchmaking, users fall into 2 general categories, donors and homes. When a donor is signing up, they fill out a form with what they are willing and able to donate. When a home signs up for the website, their general contact information is displayed, last visitation date and a list of their most pressing needs. This means that donors can easily contact the homes, faciliating ease of access and increased visibility, which will hopefully result in more donations. The matchmaking system, ensures that donors are not matched with homes who have needs that they cannot provide, for example if a user is willing to donate clothes, then they will not be matched with a home that needs a new television. It ensures that a donor is always matched with a home with needs the donor can afford to provide. 

## ‚úçÔ∏è Team Philosophy
This project was developed for the Katy Youth Hacks Hackathon 2022. As a Jamaican team that was challenged to tackle a social inequality issue, we had a number of options to choose from and we chose one that we genuinely believed could be used to address social inequity beyond just being created for a hackathon, we hope that our future actions will speak louder than our ~~words~~  project. Our team demonstrates that those with technology should always strive to use it to address the problems nearest to them

## Features, Skills and Techniques
### Design
- The logo was created using Canva which is an online design software
- The Webite's desing was done using Cascading Style Sheets. The colour scheme was specifically chosen to be cool, friendly and welcoming to encourage donors to make contributions to the houses. The sun represents a rise in the change we hope to bring.

### Python 
We used python to link the backend database with the html code. That is, Python and HTML were used to store signup information of both the homes and the donors. We also used python as the matchmaking system, our code matches the budgets and previously mentioned criteria. It then "matches" a donor to a home and this is shown on a popup card, displaying all the homes information. 

### HTML
Our project was mostly built on a combination of HTML and CSS. HTML was used to generate containers and display the navbar, signup forms, images, and link all the pages together among many other things.

- Image mapping for multiple pages
- Formatting images and background
- Hyperlinks
- Forms
- Navigation Bar

### Security
The login is a user authentication process which ensures that while the site is visible, there is a certain level of security. For example, if a user is using the system improperly, then they can be identified via their email address or other means.
